Follow the instructions on the spreadsheet for new members or new logos.

New Logo:

When a company sends a new logo, download and then use Paint to create a square logo. Then set the dimensions to 75px using XnView (freeware) or a similar free program. Name it appropriately (###.jpg or ###.png) and then commit the file to Github. Its URL will then be automatically generated by the spreadsheet.

To save even more space, I then used FileMind QuickFix to remove unnecessary EXIF metadata from the .jpg files outputted by XnView.

If there is a new TRIPLE member logo, either replace the file 000_75px.jpg in the repository, or add a new file to the repository and change the URL in cell I2 accordingly.

Spreadsheet:

The highlighted columns must be filled in manually with the appropriate information, then the spreadsheet will automatically generate an HTML string in Column S that can be added to the HTML code to accomodate the new TRIPLE member or member logo.

Click and drag on the Excel sheet to add multiple members at once. To add code for all members at once, click on cell S2 and drag to last cell in column S, click Ctrl+C, then click Ctrl+V in the code below the line that says //make markers.

If there are problems, go to the individual member where the problem occurs and make sure the name and description do not contain any whitespace.

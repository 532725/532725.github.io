Follow the instructions on the spreadsheet for new members or new logos.

When a company sends a new logo, download and then use Paint to create a square logo. Then set the dimensions to 75px using XnView (freeware) or a similar free program. Name it appropriately (###.jpg or ###.png) and then commit the file to Github. Its URL will then be automatically generated by the spreadsheet.

To save even more space, can try removing EXIF metadata from the logo files.

The bolded columns must be filled in manually, then the spreadsheet will automatically generate an HTML string in Column S that can be added to the HTML code to accomodate the new TRIPLE member or member logo.

If there are problems, go to the individual member and make sure the name and description do not contani whitespace.
